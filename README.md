Hello friends, we will be deploying a Petshop Java Based Application. This is an everyday use case scenario used by several organizations. We will be using Jenkins as a CICD tool and deploying our application on a Docker container and Kubernetes cluster. Hope this detailed blog is useful.
We will be deploying our application in two ways, one using Docker Container and the other using K8S cluster.
